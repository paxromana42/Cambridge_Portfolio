## What is this course? 

Cambridge Studies in Science – Honours is an advanced science course that involves two weeks of intensive study with the faculty at Cambridge University and a series of discussions with a WCC Honours professor before and after the trip to England.  Students register for FOUR (4) specialized seminars in the Science Summer School at Cambridge University and attend one class per day, in addition to the daily Plenary Lecture Series. All written work is submitted to and graded by the WCC instructor upon the student’s return to Westchester Community College. Students receive an official Certificate of Completion from Cambridge University and three (3) WCC Honours Science credits. 

## Administrative Expectations 

The student is expected to attend pre-trip orientation sessions and fulfil all the administrative requirements in a timely manner, e.g., trip payments, medical information/waiver, International Student ID card, Passport. The student will establish an email link to be used with the WCC Mentor during the course.

## Expectations of Student Behaviour

### Student Conduct

Students are expected to be representatives of the Honours Program, Westchester Community College and the United States.  Students will be expected to follow the WCC Student Code of Conduct.  

### Academic Dishonesty

Students are expected to complete and turn in their own work. Cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated.  If a student is found to have engaged in any form of academic dishonesty, he or she will be given an F for that assignment, and will be referred to the Dean of Students for additional sanctions from the College. See the Westchester Community College Policy on Academic Dishonesty for more information. 

### Attendance and Participation

Students are expected to attend all lectures at Cambridge. Missing more than one lecture will result in the student not receiving their Certificate of Completion and therefore will receive an F for the course. Note that some Cambridge instructors count a late arrival as an absence. 

## Course Elements

### Before Cambridge 

In preparation for the science seminars that students have chosen, specific readings will be assigned for each student on his/her chosen topics. Additionally, all science students will have a common reading program of cultural/historical context.  

Students will keep a reading journal that will be comprised of summary/reactions for each of the two common required books, and for each of the required course-specific readings (articles, web pages, books, etc). Each of these responses should be at least 500 words long.  

Additionally, the student will (with consultation with the faculty mentor) choose a topic to write a 5-10 page (double-spaced, 12 point font, 1-inch margins) research paper on. The topic and much of the research will be completed before going to Cambridge; classes at 
Cambridge will round out the research for the paper.  

**The reading journal will be worth 20% of the final WCC grade. The research paper will be worth 40% of the final WCC grade.**   

 

## At Cambridge 

The student will attend every session of each seminar and participate in class discussions and in out-of-class projects, as appropriate. Students will attend the Plenary Sessions held each morning in each of the two (2) weeks. Students must attend at least 8 of the 10 Plenary Sessions (missing sessions of the seminar and more than two (2) of the Plenary Sessions, without medical excuse, will cause the student NOT to receive the “Certificate of Completion” which is required by WCC for a passing grade in the WCC 3 credit course.  Some Cambridge Lecturers consider being late an absence.) The student will take notes during the seminars and date them.  He/she will review these class notes on a daily basis to add other comments upon reflection and /or from the reading associated with the lectures and use free time (afternoons, evenings and weekends) to read and/or review readings as directed in class. 

**Critiques of at least (2) plenary sessions (at least 500 words each) will each be worth 5% each of the final WCC grade.** 

## Post Cambridge 

The student will hand in no later than noon, Friday August 5, 2023 to the WCC Mentor, a photocopy of the complete set of longhand notes (as amended upon reflection) for each of the seminars, a copy of the Certificate of Completion, the final research paper, critiques of the plenary sessions and the cultural events papers (described below).  The WCC Mentor will read them through and will set up an appointment before 23 August 2023 for an “open notes” discussion with the student. This oral exam will be both a discourse on what the student learned from each seminar and a dialogue with the WCC mentor on the content covered in the seminars.  The student will be expected to demonstrate the synthesis made between the seminar points and the reading in particular, and an understanding of science as a discipline in general.   

**This discourse/dialogue will be worth 10% of the final WCC grade. The photocopy of class notes is worth 10% of the final WCC grade.**

## Cultural Events 

Students are expected to take advantage of the many opportunities for cultural enrichment while at Cambridge. Some events are planned and offered by the Cambridge Summer Schools, some are organized by the faculty mentors, and others can be impromptu trips or visits that students plan themselves. At least (3) reflections/reaction papers must be written about cultural events/trips. These should be about 1 page each (at least 500 words) and serve to provide a summary of the event, and the student’s reaction to it.  

**The (3) cultural events papers will be worth 5% each of the final WCC grade.**
