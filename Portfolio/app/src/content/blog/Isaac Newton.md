*Isaac Newton*, written by James Gleick and published in 2003 by Pantheon Books, is a comprehensive biography of the great mathematician and physicist. It covers Newton's early years, his education, his work on the laws of motion, his discovery of calculus, his theories of light and his contributions to the study of gravity.  

The book begins with a description of Newton's humble beginnings. He was born in 1642 in Woolsthorpe, England, to a family of farmers. James notes how Newton never left the 150 miles from his home in Cambridge to London. Newton's father, also Isaac Newton, died before he was born and his mother remarried when he was three years old, leaving him to be raised by his grandmother. Chaos reigned over the time period Newton called his youth, which he epitomised: he built sundials, paper kites, models of feats of engineering and other ways of using his mind.  

After a brief altercation where Newton's mother tried to form him into a farmer, he was sent to study at Trinity College, Cambridge at the behest of his uncle. It was here that he began to develop his theories on motion and calculus, mostly as a criticism against the scholastic tradition of late Middle Ages. Informed by the newest scientific achievements, Newton challenged many of Aristotle’s assumptions, most notably through the concept of forces. This was possible through his ability to generalise complex systems easily. This led to a tackling of the subject of gravity by applying this forces system to the Sun and Earth. Ultimately, Newton attempted to underline what the role of observation and other parts of the scientific method which he’d then apply in his future research.  

Using his new philosophical approach to research, Newton devoured the latest scientific discoveries of his time. Taking these, he created his "Reflecting Telescope," a far more accurate tool to analyse the cosmos than his contemporaries. This experimentation eventually led to a deeper dive into light and colour theory. Newton believed that white light was made up of a spectrum of colours, and he demonstrated this by passing a white light through a prism. He also studied the nature of colour, and he developed the idea that colour was not an inherent property of objects but was instead a result of the way light interacted with those objects. On a personal level, much of research now cause Newton conflict with his fellows, like Sir Hook. Newton's analysis on his surrounding were clearly far superior now given his new tools, making many disputes matters of pride. The book has a few which are not held to as good light as the above inventions.  

Newton was a devoted alchemist, devouring the subject and his contemporaries' analysis of alchemical substances and forces. Nevertheless, as a faulty science, the progress made with these arts made them a time sink for Newton rather than a positive influence. In matters of the divine, Newton was a heretic. He denied the trinity and made it a point to try and find the "true gospel" hidden in the pages of the scripture’s Romanish Medieval accretions, namely by way of prophecy and his private Christology. As a secular book, the devotion to arcane, heretical theology by Newton is not seen well by Gleick. Subtly, the point is made that Newton only focused on alchemy and theology for two reasons: his lack of a father and pride in being a dissenter from tradition. These are not good reasons, of course, but are fundamental to understanding the thoughts of Newton across his lifetime.  

Gleick focuses on how Newton's ideas became widespread. Notably, his interactions with Sir Halley and the publishing of *Principia Mathematica*. This greatly changed Newton's personal live, from the future priest to now intellectual, and the wider society in general, as his works permeated all levels of society. Though Newton was ascendant, he couldn’t maintain it forever. His failing mental health and conflicted spirituality afflicted his output. Though he had the support and detraction of many, Sir Halley and Sir Hook respectively for each side, Newtons life ended. The world was changing once more, and from dust he comes, to dust he returned. Newton died in 1726, with his life's work inspiring much of the coming Scientific Age to come.  

Overall, Isaac Newton is a well-written and informative biography that sheds light on the life and work of one of the most important figures in the history of science. Gleick's thorough research and engaging writing style make the book an enjoyable and enlightening read. It was definitely worth it to delve into it for this reading journal.
