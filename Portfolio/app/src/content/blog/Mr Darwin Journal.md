*The Reluctant Mr. Darwin* is a comprehensive biography of Charles Darwin written by David Quammen, an award-winning science writer. The book offers a fascinating, detailed look into the life and work of one of the most influential figures in the history of science. Quammen traces Darwin's journey from a young man with an interest in natural history to the author of *On the Origin of Species* in simple but direct language, making Darwin's influence on history evident and far-reaching.  

The book begins with a description of Darwin's childhood and education, exploring the family background and intellectual climate that shaped his thinking. The author connects this to Creationists and others who deny the full implications of what he calls the anti-anthropological revolution. Following this, Quammen shows how Darwin's interest in natural history developed early on, and how his experiences on the HMS Beagle, where he served as a naturalist, provided the foundation for his later work.  

Taking his experiences on the Beagle to heart, Darwin faces difficulty with his health and the deep doubts he harboured about his own abilities. Despite these challenges, Darwin persevered. Quammen describes the evolution of his thinking as he developed his theory of evolution by natural selection in the midst of this confusion.  

One of the way Darwin did this was through his observations on Kiwi eggs, as they made little sense to Darwin prima facia. His experiences as a writer, his journal from his time on the Beagle were becoming popular, drove him to try to develop these ideas more directly. Darwin uses where began to use his experiences to write the following observation, "In the view of life with its powers of growth, assimilation and reproduction, [...] through the process of gradual selection of infinitesimal changes, endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been evolved" (pp. 60-61).  

In spite of all these achievements, Darwin stumbled. From 1844-59, Darwin did nothing towards advocating for his findings. Quammen goes through a number of reason why—religion, class, family, politics— and how each ate away into Darwin's commitment to his own ideas. While he might have published surrounding date about his trip, his hesitancy about publishing on the *Origin of Species*[^1] ultimately drives much speculation about this time period. His family's health, other studies and success shows Darwin to be a man reaching his stride in certain areas, but with unachieved potential.  

While he was embroiled in a study of barnacles, Darwin's claim to fame for his view of evolution was under threat. A fellow scientist, Alfred R. Wallace, also found information which matched Darwin's conclusions. While that was happening, Darwin stayed in an eternal loop of editing his theories, suffering personal losses and trying to move forward. Wallace began to compete with Darwin, both directly and indirectly, for their conclusions.  

As soon as Darwin became aware of this, he was crushed. His perfectionism and pride allowed another to reach his conclusions.[^2] However, Darwin had better connections compared to Wallace; when Darwin's friends heard about this conundrum, they developed a plan to give their friend the glory while dismissing any accusations of malfeasance. From there, a complex interplay between Darwin, his friends and Wallace began. When all was said and done, *On the Origin of Species* was published, and Wallace is often a footnote in history.  

The "Darwinian" revolution was not as widespread as one might think. Quammen lays that at two reasons, the reactions of religious sensibilities and the still burning questions around the validity of the theory. Most terrible was the conclusion that evolution directly contradicted humanity's divine ordinance on Earth. Moreover, much of the intelligentsia of the time dismissed some claims of Darwin as illogical and impossible. This was both true and not, as Quammen explains that not all accusation were spurious or misguided, but rather pointed out some flaws in Darwin's model. The issue was that Darwin had no power to accurately defend his thesis, but instead would periodically relent to these critics. Much of these academic errors and missteps have been addressed in the model named after Darwin, neo-Darwinism.  

Darwin, as all men do, grew old and died. He continued his work in limited ways, received mail from across the world, was honoured in a variety of ways and had his family grew distant. Dependent on his wife, he was old and lonely, though her presence made it more bearable. Though they disputed over the matter of religion, they remained close spouses until Darwin's death in 1882. His body was laid to rest in Westminster Abbey, and the book closes on an anecdote on the shyness of this old man who didn't want to cause the world more fuss.[^3]

Overall, *The Reluctant Mr. Darwin* provides a rich and nuanced understanding of one of the most important figures in the history of science. Whether you are a student of biology or simply interested in the history of ideas, this book is an engaging and enlightening read. While some of the author's biases become clear early on, especially in his rant on anti-anthropology revolution and the oppressive power of religion in the past and present, he still fairly objective in his portrayal of Darwin and his life. Would recommend this book to people interested in this time period, though with the caveat that the author makes the portrayal more political than necessary.

# Notes

 [^1]: Quammen references *On the Origin of Species* as a work, while it's not published yet. I don't know if this is anachronistic or if the extended essay had this same title.
 [^2]: The author notes that Wallace's conclusion is not synonymous with Darwin's, as Darwin's theories have a different focus compared to Wallace's.
 [^3]: It's my favourite section of the book, dealing with Darwin as a person rather than a vehicle for Quammen's imperial secularism.
