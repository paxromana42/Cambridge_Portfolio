# The Reluctant Mr Darwin

*The Reluctant Mr. Darwin* is a comprehensive biography of Charles Darwin written by David Quammen, an award-winning science writer. The book offers a fascinating, detailed look into the life and work of one of the most influential figures in the history of science. Quammen traces Darwin's journey from a young man with an interest in natural history to the author of *On the Origin of Species* in simple but direct language, making Darwin's influence on history evident and far-reaching.  

The book begins with a description of Darwin's childhood and education, exploring the family background and intellectual climate that shaped his thinking. The author connects this to Creationists and others who deny the full implications of what he calls the anti-anthropological revolution. Following this, Quammen shows how Darwin's interest in natural history developed early on, and how his experiences on the HMS Beagle, where he served as a naturalist, provided the foundation for his later work.  

Taking his experiences on the Beagle to heart, Darwin faces difficulty with his health and the deep doubts he harboured about his own abilities. Despite these challenges, Darwin persevered. Quammen describes the evolution of his thinking as he developed his theory of evolution by natural selection in the midst of this confusion.

Overall, *The Reluctant Mr. Darwin* provides a rich and nuanced understanding of one of the most important figures in the history of science. Whether you are a student of biology or simply interested in the history of ideas, this book is an engaging and enlightening read. While some of the author's biases become clear early on, especially in his rant on anti-anthropology revolution and how it needs to permeate all levels of society, he still fairly objective in his portrayal of Darwin and his life.
